		<h2> About Dustin... </h2>
			<p>
			 Dustin Todd Archer was born in Red Oak, Iowa on December 13th, 1970. As he was growing up he was always running 			around outside, getting dirty and playing with toys. His favorite hobby back then was fishing with his dad Russ. 			They would spend countless hours fishing on different sandbars up and down the river and in and out of many 			different creeks. Growing up fast though he sailed by middle school and landed in high school where he made some 			lifelong friends and had the times of his life. This is where he met Joanna, had his two loving sons, Mick, and 			Matthew, and got married. Around 1993 was when Dustin started pursuing Nursing because he didn’t know what to do 			but was ushered into the field by his mother-in-law Katherine. Soon accomplishing many degrees and 					certifications this would be the start to his long career in the Nursing field. From working as an RN to an ER 			Nurse to Hospice to Acute Rehab and finally a Director of Nursing at Glenhaven Village in Glenwood, Iowa. Though 			he still works a lot he is not just about the work he does have baking goods to ease the mind along with sowing 			and embroidering. Baking is his passion as he loves to challenge himself with it. Also, spreading love through 			baked treats really warms his heart. A fun way he likes to show himself with his baking is embellishing himself 			into his pastries sometimes and adding his own unique flare to the designs that being something colorful, funny, 			lovable or putting his own family crest as a signature. This way you can always say “Oh you know Dusty made 			this!”
